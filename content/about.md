I'm a Team Lead SRE at Browserstack with 15+ years of experience in web/DevOps.

My main role is to keep the application codebase in a good shape and make sure application delivers business value. That involves such aspects as: making architectural decisions, growing developers professionally, improving team cohesion, making development process fun, contributing to product strategy and of course writing code myself.
